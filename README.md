# [StreamFans](https://streamfans.vercel.app/)

StreamFans is a blockchain-based platform that allows creators to offer exclusive content to their followers, where access is granted through real-time money streaming instead of traditional recurring payments. This innovative model fosters better interaction between creators and their audience, using blockchain technology and smart contracts to enhance the user experience.

## Key Features

- **Money Streaming for Subscription**: Users gain access to exclusive content by streaming money to creators' accounts, ensuring a fluid and dynamic payment model for as long as they are subscribed.
- **Smart Contracts and NFT Integration**: When creators activate their StreamFans profile, smart contracts are deployed, minting an NFT for each follower, allowing them access to exclusive content.
- **Exclusive Content for Subscribers**: Creators can post content visible only to subscribers, with upcoming features enhancing the interaction experience.
- **Customizable NFTs**: Soon, creators will be able to customize their follow NFT drops.
- **Video Streaming and Chat Features** (Coming Soon): Integration with **Huddle01** for live streams and **XMTP** for private chats and chatrooms with followers.

## How It Works

1. **Creators activate StreamFans Profile**: Via their dashboard, creators deploy smart contracts to their followers. 
2. **NFT Minting**: Followers are minted with an NFT upon following, which starts the money stream.
3. **Access Exclusive Content**: Followers can then enjoy exclusive posts from the creator.
4. **Future Features**: Expect customizable NFTs, private video streams, and chats with creators.

## Built With

- **[Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/)**: A composable and decentralized social graph that enables creators to monetize their content in new ways.

## Future Plans
